Welcome to the website for my Twine Game, created for the course IASC at Brock Univeristy.

Roly-Poly's Parking Lot is a short choose your own adventure game where players guide a small bug around a parking lot. As they attempt to rescue this bug, players will use energy, must find pavement pits, and attempt to save their new roly-poly friend. Roly-Poly's Parking Lot communicates a message that no matter how small an issue is, it's important to help out.
